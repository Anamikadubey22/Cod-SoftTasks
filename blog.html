                <h2>Learn HTML - in fun way !</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language . <br>
                    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages . <br>
                    HTML describes the structure of a Web page .<br>
                    HTML consists of a series of elements .<br>
                    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content .<br>
                    HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.<br>

                <h2>Learn CSS - in fun way !</h2>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in <br>
                HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered <br>
                on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized<br>
                across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification <br>
                was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, <br>
                CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.

                <h2>Learn JAVA-SCRIPT - in fun way !</h2>
                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions.<br>
                 While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,<br>
                Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting <br>
                object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime<br>
                object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection <br>
                (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
